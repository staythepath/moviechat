        "person_Gustav Hasford": {
            "biography": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nGustav Hasford (November 28, 1947 - January 29, 1993) was an American writer. His semi-autobiographical novel The Short-Timers was the basis of the film Full Metal Jacket.\n\nBorn in Russellville, Alabama, Hasford joined the United States Marine Corps in 1967 and served as a combat correspondent during the Vietnam War.\n\nHasford associated with various science fiction writers of the 1970s (including Arthur Byron Cover and David J. Skal), had works published in magazines and anthologies such as Space and Time and Damon Knight's Orbit series, and briefly shared an apartment with author Harlan Ellison.\n\nIn 1978, Hasford attended the Milford Writer's Workshop and met veteran science fiction author Frederik Pohl, who was then an editor at Bantam Books. At Pohl's suggestion, Hasford submitted The Short-Timers, and Pohl promptly bought it for Bantam. The Short-Timers became a best-seller, and was adapted into the 1987 feature film Full Metal Jacket, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay was written by Hasford, Kubrick, and screenwriter Michael Herr, and was nominated for an Academy Award. Hasford's actual contributions were a subject of dispute among the three and ultimately Hasford chose to skip the Oscar ceremonies.\n\nIn 1988, shortly before the Oscar ceremony, Hasford was charged for theft after campus police from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California, found nearly 10,000 library books in his rented storage locker. At that time, he had 87 overdue books checked out from the Cal Poly-SBO library; also five years of the magazine Civil War Times. The materials were valued at over $2,000.\n\nHasford's book collection included books borrowed (and never returned) from dozens of libraries across the United States, and from libraries in the United Kingdom and Australia. Others were allegedly taken from the homes of acquaintances. Among them were 19th-century books on Edgar Allan Poe and the American Civil War.  He had obtained borrowing privileges at Cal Poly-SBO as a California resident, but submitted a false address and Social Security number. In 1985, he had borrowed 98 books from the Sacramento, California public library, and was wanted for grand theft there.[2]\n\nHasford initially denied the charges, but eventually admitted possession of several hundred stolen books, and pled Nolo contendere (\"no contest\") to possession of stolen property. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment (of which he served three months), and promised to pay restitution from the royalties for his future works.  Hasford claimed that he wanted the books to research a never-published book on the Civil War. He described his difficulties as \"a vicious attack launched against me by moral majority fanatics backed up by the full power of the Fascist State.\"  In 1990 he published a second novel, The Phantom Blooper, a sequel to The Short-Timers.\n\nHasford's final novel was A Gypsy Good Time, a detective story set in Los Angeles. It was published in 1992, and received little notice. Hasford, suffering from diabetes, moved to the Greek island of Aegina and died there of heart failure on 29 January 1993.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Gustav Hasford, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

            "biography": "Stanley Kubrick (July 26, 1928 \u2013 March 7, 1999) was an American film director, writer, producer, and photographer who lived in England during most of the last four decades of his career. Kubrick was noted for the scrupulous care with which he chose his subjects, his slow method of working, the variety of genres he worked in, his technical perfectionism, and his reclusiveness about his films and personal life. He maintained almost complete artistic control, making movies according to his own whims and time constraints, but with the rare advantage of big-studio financial support for all his endeavors. Kubrick's films are characterized by a formal visual style and meticulous attention to detail\u2014his later films often have elements of surrealism and expressionism that eschews structured linear narrative. His films are repeatedly described as slow and methodical, and are often perceived as a reflection of his obsessive and perfectionist nature. A recurring theme in his films is man's inhumanity to man. While often viewed as expressing an ironic pessimism, a few critics feel his films contain a cautious optimism when viewed more carefully.\n\nThe film that first brought him attention to many critics was Paths of Glory (1957), the first of three films of his about the dehumanizing effects of war. Many of his films at first got a lukewarm reception, only to be years later acclaimed as masterpieces that had a seminal influence on many later generations of film-makers. Considered especially groundbreaking was 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) noted for being both one of the most scientifically realistic and visually innovative science-fiction films ever made while maintaining an enigmatic non-linear storyline. He voluntarily withdrew his film A Clockwork Orange (1971) from England, after it was accused of inspiring copycat crimes which in turn resulted in threats against Kubrick's family. His films were largely successful at the box-office, although Barry Lyndon (1975) performed poorly in the United States. Living authors Anthony Burgess and Stephen King were both unhappy with Kubrick's adaptations of their novels A Clockwork Orange and The Shining (1980) respectively, and both authors were engaged with subsequent adaptations. All of Kubrick's films from the mid-1950s to his death except for The Shining were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTAs. Although he was nominated for an Academy Award as a screenwriter and director on several occasions, his only personal win was for the special effects in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nEven though all of his films, apart from the first two, were adapted from novels or short stories, his works have been described by Jason Ankeny and others as \"original and visionary\". Although some critics, notably Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael, frequently disparaged Kubrick's work, Ankeny describes Kubrick as one of the most \"universally acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era\" with a \"standing unique among the filmmakers of his day.\"",
